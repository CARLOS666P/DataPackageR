Package development assignment as part of the Mastering Software Development in R specialization on coursera.

Assignment

Instructions

write a vignette to include in your package using knitr and R Markdown
write at least one test written using testthat put your package on GitHub
set up the repository so that the package can be checked and built on Travis
Once your package has built on Travis and the build is passing with no errors, warnings, or notes you should add your Travis badge to the README.md file of your package repository.
